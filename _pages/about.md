I am a second-year undergraduate student in the Department of Computer Science at Tsinghua University, with a minor in Linguistics & Literature. My research interests include LLM mechanisms, neuroimaging, and brain-inspired AI.

I am currently interning at THUKEG under the supervision of Prof. Juanzi Li. Previously, I interned at THBI and participated in a summer research at Oxford Universityâ€™s FMRIB, supervised by Dr. Tian Qiyuan and Prof. Wu Wenchuan.

I look forward to internship and summer research opportunities in related fields.
