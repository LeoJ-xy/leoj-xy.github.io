I am a second-year undergraduate student in the Department of Computer Science at Tsinghua University, with a minor in Linguistics & Literature. My research interests include LLM mechanisms, neuroimaging, and brain-inspired AI.

I look forward to internship and summer research opportunities in related fields.
