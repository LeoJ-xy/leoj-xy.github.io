I am a second-year undergraduate student in the Department of Computer Science at Tsinghua University, with a minor in Linguistics & Literature. My research interests include LLM mechanisms, neuroimaging, and brain-inspired AI.

I am currently interning at [THUKEG](https://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/) under the supervision of Prof. [Juanzi Li](https://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/persons/ljz/index.html). Previously, I interned at THBI and participated in a summer research at Oxford University’s FMRIB, supervised by Dr. Qiyuan Tian and Prof. Wenchuan Wu.

I look forward to internship and summer research opportunities in related fields.
