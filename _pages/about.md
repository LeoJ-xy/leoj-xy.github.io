I am a third-year undergraduate student in Xinya College and the Department of Computer Science at Tsinghua University, with a minor in Linguistics & Literature.

My research interests include:

1. **Mechanisms of large models** – investigating the mechanistic interpretability of large models by integrating interdisciplinary approaches from cognitive science, linguistics, philosophy, etc.
2. **Mechanisms for large models** – designing better model architectures, application and interaction patterns based on research into the mechanisms of large models.
3. **Humanity Intelligence** – applying AI methods to advance research in the humanities, and exploring how to enhance large models’ higher-level humanistic capabilities.

I am currently interning at [THUKEG](https://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/) and [PKUICL](https://cs.pku.edu.cn/English/People/Faculty/By_Institute/Institute_of_Computational_Linguistics.htm) under the joint supervision of Prof. [Juanzi Li](https://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/persons/ljz/index.html) and Prof. [Zhifang Sui](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=y2EaftAAAAAJ&view_op=list_works). Previously, I conducted a summer research at the University of Maryland with Prof. Jordan Boyd-Graber, and also interned at THBI and participated in a summer research at Oxford University’s FMRIB, supervised by Prof. Qiyuan Tian and Prof. Wenchuan Wu.

I look forward to internship and summer research opportunities in related fields.
